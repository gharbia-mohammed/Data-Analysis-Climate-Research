# Data Analysis Climate Research

## Project Overview

This project analyzes the long-term climate variability in North Africa from 1941 to 2020 using the ERA5 reanalysis dataset. 
The study focuses on the three main meteorological variables that directly influence renewable energy systems and heat stress in desert environments:

Air Temperature (TAS) , Wind Speed (WS) , Surface Downwelling Shortwave Radiation (RSDS)
The goal is to investigate how these variables have changed over the last eight decades 
and identify key temporal patterns that describe North Africa’s climate evolution.
